        This is a journal about finding myself by reviving my hobby of writing.
        Right now I&apos;m nowhere near where I wanna be (I mean I&apos;m a
        little bit there tho ngl).
      </p>
      <p>
        Let&apos;s go back to 2015 where it all started. I read some novels and
        books and suddenly I wanted to create and write my own stories. I did
        write a few pieces of prose, essays, journals and stories on my diary or
        a notebook. Nobody would believe me that I thought about a similar story
        like the movie Brahmastra after reading and watching Percy Jackson. Also
        if I look back and see my writings which are so embarrassing to read.
        But hey, we start somewhere right? ofcourse we do!
      </p>
      <p>
        In the mists of all this, life happened, COVID, 2020, and my breakup
        happened. Between personal and political implosions, I lost this
        hobby(among other things as well).
      </p>
      <p>
        However I&apos;m at a better place and in the pursuit of finding my own
        self, and revive my hobby and write casually. It most likely will remain
        so at times because this, my friend, is just a journal of my life. No
        ads, no sponsorships, no income. The page views are about as low as my
        motivation to write. This is the reason why I&apos;m starting this
        journal in the first place, to get back better at writing again.
      </p>
      <p>
        It&apos;s always been, and will probably stay, just a notebookâ€”a space
        to gather random thoughts, memories, and feelings. A little light in the
        tunnel of life, where I&apos;m always glad to have some like-minded
        company.
